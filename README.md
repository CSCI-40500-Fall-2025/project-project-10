# Project 10

## Product Vision

FOR new hires and summer interns
WHO need to find housing in a new area permanently or for a summer for the purposes of a new job and finding a roommate.
Find Housing is a social media app sort of like linkedin 
THAT helps match people from similar companies in similar areas and helps find housing in commonly requested areas by multiple parties.
UNLIKE any other app that exists today
OUR PRODUCT aims to make finding housing either temporarily or permanently with roommates easier.
